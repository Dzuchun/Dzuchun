## Greetings,

I working on projects I like in a hope to make something to be proud of.
I happen to have some experience in [Java], [Lua](just a bit), [C#], [Python], [JS] and [Rust]. C++ does not exist.

### I'm in search for an intership right now,
so if you happen to have such an offer, here is [my cv].

### I am a proud participant of a [Summer 2023 Rust Bootcamp],
and I'm really optimistic about learning Rust for now. Hope that **will** last for a <s>long</s>i64 time.

### Recently I've finished [this].
Hope someone would find it useful ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### That's it for now. Hope to update this page soon...
